/**
 * A <code>DirectedGraph</code> whose Nodes may be compound {@link Subgraph}s, which may
 * contain other nodes. Any node in the graph may be parented by one subgraph. Since
 * subgraphs are nodes, the source or target end of an {@link Edge} may be a subgraph.
 * For additional restrictions, refer to the JavaDoc for the layout algorithm being used.
 * <P>
 * A CompoundDirectedGraph is passed to a graph layout, which will position all of the
 * nodes, subgraphs, and edges in that graph.  This class serves as the data structure for
 * a layout algorithm.
